####1. *If I am already using gsDevKitHome, why should I consider moving to GsDevKit_home?*

1. GsDevKit_home has been made more modular with separate git projects for the tODE client and GemStone servers. With a new, modular directory structure, project-specific (private) files like session descriptions, tODE scripts and customized `system.conf` files are co-located in a separate git project [(GsDevKit_local_sys][5]) that can be managed in a private repository (i.e., [BitBucket][6]) keeping your team's private shared data private.
  Modules for development clients like [Jade][3] and [GemTools][4] can be added to GsDevKit_home, as well as modules for production tools like [Daemon Tools][8], [Monit][9], [Apache][10], [nginx][12], [lightppd][11], etc.

2. By default, git-based repositories used by GsDevKit_home are cloned thus reducing the reliance on network and making for more reliable builds. The ulitmate goal is to move all projects used by GsDevKit to [git][13] so that builds can be done without a network connection.

3. It is no longer necessary to fork the GsDevKit_home project as part of the installation process.

4. Better support for Windows users. The installation process for the Windows, Linux and OSX platforms is the same.

####100. *How do I contribute to the GsDevKit_home project?*
When you decide that you would like to contribute bugfixes or improvements to the  GsDevKit_home family of projects:
 - [GsDevKit_home][15]
 - [GsDevKit_gs_client_dev][16]
 - [GsDevKit_gs_server][17]
 - [GsDevKit_todeClient][18]
 - [GsDevKit_sys_local][19]) 

or the git-based projects used by GsDevKit_home:
 - [Metacello][20]
 - [Tode][21]
 - [Ston][22]
 - [FileTree][23]
 - [Grease][24]
 - [GLASS1][25]
 - [PharoCompatibility][26]
 - [RB][27])

You start by forking the project of interest on [GitHub][14], set up your GitHub account for ssh access. 
Then you perform the following steps in your local checkout (assuming the your GitHub user-name is `dalehenrich` and the project you want to contribute to is GsDevKit_home, which you've already cloned):

```shell
git remote add dale git@github.com:dalehenrich/GsDevKit_home.git
git fetch --all
git checkout master
git checkout -b topicBranch
# do work for contribution committing along the way
git commit -m"final commit"
git push dale topicBranch
```

Then on GitHub, open a pull request from the `topicBranch` in your fork, to the `master` branch that you forked from.
