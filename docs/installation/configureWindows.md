# Configuring Windows to run GsDevKit

GsDevKit clients are supported on Windows.  You will also need to have a Linux or Mac, or a VM running 
one of these platforms, to install the GsDevKit server.

The installation of GitHub on windows provides a shell environment that can be used to run the DevKit tODE client.


1. Download and install *GitHub for Windows* by following the instructions on the [GitHub for Windows][1] page.

2. In *GitHub for Windows*, go to the *Options page* and set your default shell to **Git Bash**.

3. Close the *Github for Windows* window; this will not be used for any further GsDevKit work.  
 
   Open a **Git Bash** shell window by clicking on the *Git Shell* icon on your desktop.  

4. On Windows, which has [path length limitations][2], tODE client file paths risk running up against the character limits.  To avoid issues, enable longpaths in git, and reduce overhead by choosing an installation directory with a short path. 
  
   execute the following:
   ```
   git config --global core.longpaths true   
   ```

   We recommend that the client be installed in the root directory of the user's directory.  
   You may install elsewhere, but longer paths may create problems for some tODE operations.
