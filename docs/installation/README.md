# Installation Overview

GsDevKit is a client-server environment, involving a GUI devlopment environment (tODE) based on Pharo, and a server (stone) based on GemStone/S 64 bit.  The installation process involves cloning projects from github, downloading and configuring Pharo and GUI client components, and downloading, configuring, and starting the GemStone server (the stone process and supporting processes).  While the details are handled for you by the installations cripts, there are some decisions that  must be made  before installing.

GsDevKit can be installed under three configurations.

(1) **Everything on a single workstation**.  Since this machine must already have a window manager in order to display the desktop, and since the GsDevKit installation can be shared, it is the simpliest approach.

(2) **Client on a local workstation, Server on a remote host**. The GUI client (such as tODE in Pharo) on one workstation, connecting to a GsDevKit server installation on a separate node.  You will need to install twice, installing the client on one machine and the server on another machine.  The remote machine (or VM) does not need a window manager, e.g. a Linux server installation.  This is generally the solution if your desktop machine is running Windows.

(3) **Everything on a remote server, accessed via X-forwarding**. Both the GUI client and the server installed on a remote machine.  The remote machine does not need a window manager, but will need to have an X11 client installed.  The local client desktop machine has a window manager (obviously) and will run an X11 server.  Using  ssh -X to connect to the remote machine allows the  GUI client to display on the local machine.  This approach may suffer from performance issues, even with ssh -X compression.  If you are familiar with cygwin or otherwise have an X11 server for windows,  this approach may be used from a Windows client machine; but this configuration is not included with these installation instructions.

### Client and Server naming

To get started with GsDevKit, you will be installing a server and a client.  This may be done in a single step, or by installing separately on different nodes.  Since you can have multiple servers on the same node, or multiple clients, the clients and the servers (stones) are named.  In the examples, we use devKit_329 for the name of the server (stone), and tode1 for the name of the tODE client.

# Installation on a single desktop
You may install the client and server portions at the same time in a shared directory structure.
This can be done on Linux (desktop) or on Mac.

   1. Login to your desktop, and ensure that the required OS packages are installed.

      * **Linux**: [Configure Linux Desktop][1]

      * **Mac OS X**: [Configure Mac][2]

   2. Install the GsDevKit Client and Server.  This is done with a single command, that installs both within the same directory structure, creates the stone (server) instance and the tODE client instance, and starts up the stone.
    
      * [Install Server and Client][3]
   
   3. [Start Using tODE][13]

---
# Installing separate server and client

The server may be installed on Linux or on Mac, and the client may be on Linux desktop, Mac, or Windows.

1. Log into the remote machine on which you will be installing the GsDevKit server, and configure the OS prerequisites specific to the Server.

    * **Linux**: [Configure Linux Server][4]   

    * **Mac OS X**: [Configure Mac][5]   

2. Also on the remote node, install the GsdevKit server. This will create and startup the stone (the GsDevkit server instance).

   * [Install Server][6]

3. Log into the Desktop client, on which you will install the GsDevKit client, and configure the OS prerequities that are specific to the client.   
 
    * **Linux**: [Configure Linux Desktop][7]   
 
    * **Mac OS X**: [Configure Mac][8]   

    * **Windows**: [Configure Windows][9]   

4. Install the GsDevKit client.  This will create the tODE client, but not start it up.

    * [Install Client][10]

5. [Start Using tODE][13]

# Installing on a remote node using X forwarding

Both GsDevKit components, client and server, are on the same node, which is generally a linux server (i.e, a linux installation with no Window Manager). This configuration in general will have performance issues, and one of the other configurations is recommended.  

You can connect using X-forwarding from a Linux desktop (that is, a Linux installation that includes a Window Manager), or from the Mac.  It is also possible to connect from a Windows desktop by installing cygwin or another application that provides an X11-server, but this is outside the scope of these instructions.

   1. Login to the remote linux server node, and install the OS rerequsites for both Client and Server (other than the display related requirements).

      * **Linux**: [Configure Linux Server][11]

   2. Also on the remote node, install both GsDevKit Client and Server.  This will install both within the same directory structure, and create the stone (server) instance and the tODE client instance, and start up the stone.
    
      * [Install Server and Client][3]

   3. On the desktop, install any required OS add-ons:
   
       * **Linux**: no action required, since Linux desktop should have X-windows installed
   
       * **Mac OS X**: [Configure Mac For X-Forwarding][12]

   4. Connect from desktop to remote node using X forwarding

   5. [Start Using tODE][13]
