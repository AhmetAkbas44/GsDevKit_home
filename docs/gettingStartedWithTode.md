###Open a tODE client image

Once you have installed the server and tODE client, you can open the tODE client and start using it.

On the client node, if you have not already done so, startup the tODE client by executing:
```
startClient <clientName>
```

Use the name of the client you created.  These instructions have used the client name **tode1**, in which case you would execute

```
startClient tode1
```

Note that the script `clients` will list all installed clients.

the tODE image will come up.  To get started using tODE, you'll open the tODE shell using the popup menu, and select the stone you will be using.  In this example, it's `devKit_329`.

###Open a tODE project list
