###Open a tODE client image

Once you have installed the server and tODE client, you can open the tODE client and start using it.

On the client node, if you have not already done so, startup the tODE client by executing:
```
startClient <clientName>
```

Use the name of the client you created.  These instructions have used the client name **tode1**, in which case you would execute

```
startClient tode1
```

Note that the script `clients` will list all installed clients.

The image looks like this:

![tode image][2]


###Open a tODE shell

Once a tode client image is open, use the following menu to open a tODE shell:  
   
![open tode shell][1]

### Verify your connection to the server

Verify login by entering testLogin at the tODE shell prompt

![tODE Test Login][4] 

###Open a tODE project list

Open a tODE a *Project List Browser* using the `project list` tODE command:

![project list][3]
